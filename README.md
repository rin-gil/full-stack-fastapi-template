# Full Stack FastAPI Template (Refactored)

> **Note:** This project is a comprehensive architectural refactoring of the original project [fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template).

The main goal of this fork is to evolve the original template into an opinionated, production-ready boilerplate, showcasing modern best practices for both backend and frontend development. The focus has shifted from a simple template to a robust foundation with a clean, scalable, and testable architecture.

## About this Project

This project is designed as a learning resource and a high-quality starting point for new applications. Key philosophies include:

-   **Explicit is better than implicit:** Dependencies, configurations, and data flows are clearly defined.
-   **Clean Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns between layers (presentation, business logic, data access).
-   **Modern Best Practices:** Utilization of the latest stable features from FastAPI, React, and their respective ecosystems.

## Key Architectural Decisions

This project implements several key patterns that define its structure:

### Backend

-   **Layered Architecture:** The code is strictly separated into layers: `routes` (presentation), `deps` (dependency management), `crud` (data access), and `core` (business logic and configuration).
-   **Object-Oriented Design:** The entire backend is rewritten using classes (`AppFactory`, class-based views, provider classes, repositories) to improve encapsulation, reusability, and testability.
-   **Explicit Dependency Management:** A central `deps.py` module defines all FastAPI dependencies as "callable" provider classes, ensuring consistency and clean, predictable code.
-   **Repository Pattern:** Database operations are encapsulated in `CRUD` classes, abstracting away the data access logic from the business logic.

### Frontend

-   **Component-Driven Architecture:** The UI is built using a feature-based structure. A clear distinction is made between reusable UI primitives (`/components/ui`) and feature-specific components (`/components`).
-   **Centralized State Management:** Server state is exclusively managed by **TanStack Query**, which acts as a single source of truth for all API data, handling caching, refetching, and synchronization.
-   **The "Action-Dialog" Pattern:** A standardized pattern for components that trigger actions in a dialog (e.g., Edit, Delete), separating the `Trigger` from the `Dialog` to ensure a clean, unidirectional data flow.
